# Terraform Word Shuffle

This Terraform configuration allows you to generate random words from various categories using the `random_shuffle` resource. You can customize the word categories and their contents to suit your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Git (for cloning the repository, if not already installed)

## Getting Started

### Installation


Usage
Initialize Terraform: Initialize Terraform and download the required provider plugins.

```
terraform init
```
Plan the Changes: Generate an execution plan for your infrastructure changes to ensure everything is set up correctly.

```
terraform plan
```
Sample Output:

```
...

Plan: X to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```
Apply the Changes: Apply the changes to create the shuffled word lists.

```
terraform apply
```
Sample Output:

```
...

Apply complete! Resources: X added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
````
Show State Details: Display detailed information about your infrastructure state.

```
terraform show
```
Sample Output:

```
...

names = ["word1", "word2", ...]
```
Cleanup: To clean up and destroy the created resources, use the terraform destroy command.

```
terraform destroy
```
Sample Output:

```
...

Destroy complete! Resources: X destroyed.
```
Customization
You can customize the word lists by editing the variables.tf file. The words variable contains different word categories with lists of words. Modify the word lists in each category to suit your requirements.

```
variable "words" {
  description = "A word pool to use for Mad Libs"
  type        = map(list(string))
  default = {
    nouns      = ["army", "panther", "walnuts", "sandwich", "Zeus", "banana", "cat", "jellyfish", "jigsaw", "violin", "milk", "sun"]
    adjectives = ["bitter", "sticky", "thundering", "abundant", "chubby", "grumpy"]
    verbs      = ["run", "dance", "love", "respect", "kicked", "baked"]
    adverbs    = ["delicately", "beautifully", "quickly", "truthfully", "wearily"]
    numbers    = [42, 27, 101, 73, -5, 0]
  }
}
```
Feel free to modify the word categories and their contents as needed.

Viewing Shuffled Words
