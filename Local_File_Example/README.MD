# Terraform Local File Example
This Terraform configuration creates a local_file resource that writes a greeting message to a file called Hello.txt.

# Usage
# Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/vijaybiradar/Terraform_Test.git

# Change directory to the repository:

cd Local_File_Example
# Initialize the Terraform configuration:

terraform init
# Apply the Terraform configuration:

terraform apply -var name="Vijay"
This will create a file called Hello.txt with the content "Hello, Vijay!" in the current directory.

# Inputs:

Name	Description	Type	Default
name	The name to include in the greeting message	string	"World"

# Outputs:

Name	Description
hello_file_path	The file path of the Hello.txt file
In this example, we've included instructions on how to use the Terraform configuration, as well as a table of inputs and outputs. The table provides a clear and concise overview of the configuration's inputs and outputs, making it easier for users to understand how to use the configuration.

You can customize the greeting message by setting the name input variable. By default, the greeting will say "Hello, World!".
