# Terraform Local File Example

This Terraform configuration creates a `local_file` resource that writes a greeting message to a file called `Hello.txt`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-local-file-example.git

css
Copy code

2. Change directory to the repository:

cd terraform-local-file-example

markdown
Copy code

3. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

terraform init

markdown
Copy code

4. Apply the Terraform configuration:

terraform apply -var name="John"

perl
Copy code

This will create a file called `Hello.txt` with the content "Hello, John!" in the current directory.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| `name` | The name to include in the greeting message | `string` | `"World"` |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hello_file_path` | The file path of the `Hello.txt` file |

In this example, we've added a README.md file that includes instructions on how to use the Terraform configuration, as well as a table of inputs and outputs. The table provides a clear and concise overview of the configuration's inputs and outputs, making it easier for users to understand how to use the configuration.

Overall, this example demonstrates best practices for creating a Terraform configuration that includes documentation to help users understand how to use the configuration.
